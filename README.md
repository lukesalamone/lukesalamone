### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm Luke, a Master's student currently studying Artificial Intelligence at Northwestern University. I'm from Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. (Our city is named after the Potawatomi word for firefly ðŸ˜€) Previously, I worked as a Senior Software engineer at Capital One. I'm currently working on a few different projects related to machine learning, especially natural language processing. 

I'm also on the hunt for an internship for this summer, so if you're hiring reach out! I can most easily be reached via:
